# New Frontend for Dependency-Track

**Original Item:** "New Frontend (or refactoring the current one) for Dependency-Track that does not need any login to search and find results for libs (Hendrik)"

## Problem Statement

Users need an account to search and find libs in Dependency-Track.

## Current State / Starting Point

We provide a public Dependency-Track instance for the community.
The current frontend needs a login to search and find results for libs.
Next to that the general Dependency-Track frontend is not that intuitive to find libs and their known vulnerabilities.


## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

A simple to use frontend that does not require a login and provides security relevant information.
