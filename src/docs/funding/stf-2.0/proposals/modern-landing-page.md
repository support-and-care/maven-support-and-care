# Modern Landing Page for Maven Homepage

**Original Item:** "Modern landing page for Maven Homepage (Hendrik)"

**Note (Green):** "Maybe something that is independent of the current Homepage that is generated by Maven Site plugin"

## Problem Statement

https://maven.apache.org is not very appealing.
The landing page should be modern and provide a good user experience.
It should invite new users to try Maven and provide links to relevant documentation.

## Current State / Starting Point

Today the landing page is generated by Maven Site Plugin.
We should find a better way for the landing page to create an excellent user experience.

## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

A new and modern landing page for Maven.
