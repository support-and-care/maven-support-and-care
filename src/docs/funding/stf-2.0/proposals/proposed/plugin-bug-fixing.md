# Bug Fixing / Issues and PR Review in Maven Plugins

**Discussion:** https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/190

## Problem Statement

Numerous Maven plugins have accumulated unresolved issues and pending pull requests. Reported issues often have no comments, and PRs submitted by contributors wait for review and merge for extended periods. This discourages community contributions and leaves known bugs unfixed.

## Current State / Starting Point

- Many Maven plugins have open issues without any maintainer response
- Contributed pull requests wait for review for long periods
- No structured process for regular triage and review of plugin issues
- Community contributors lose motivation when their work goes unreviewed

## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

1. **Regular Triage**: Dedicated monthly time allocations for reviewing and triaging open issues across Maven plugins
2. **PR Reviews**: Systematic review of pending pull requests, either merging or providing actionable feedback
3. **Bug Fixes**: Resolution of confirmed bugs, especially those with community-contributed fixes
4. **Improved Contributor Experience**: Faster feedback loops encouraging continued community participation
