# Modern Landing Page for Maven Homepage

**Discussion:** https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/178

**Original Item:** "Modern landing page for Maven Homepage (Hendrik)"

**Note (Green):** "Maybe something that is independent of the current Homepage that is generated by Maven Site plugin"

## Problem Statement

https://maven.apache.org is not very appealing.
The landing page should be modern and provide a good user experience.
It should invite new users to try Maven and provide links to relevant documentation.

## Current State / Starting Point

Today the landing page is generated by Maven Site Plugin.
We should find a better way for the landing page to create an excellent user experience.

## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

A new and modern landing page for Maven.

## Discussion Summary

The feedback suggested the [real issue is content, not technology](https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/178#discussioncomment-15548847) — the site plugin is not the problem, but rather what information is presented and how it is organized.
The proposal should focus on content strategy and information architecture rather than just a visual refresh.
