# GitHub/Codeberg Pages Hosting for Maven Sites

**Discussion:** https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/171

**Original Item:** "Make it easy (documentation?) to automatically create a Maven site for a GitHub-hosted project as a GitHub page, same for Codeberg/ Forgejo (Hendrik)"

## Problem Statement

The documentation of a Maven plugin is part of the generated site (generated by maven-site-plugin) that must be hosted somewhere.

## Current State / Starting Point

We can host the generated site on any webserver.

## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

Super easy and intuitive support (documentation) to host the generated site on GitHub pages (same for Codeberg/ Forgejo).
