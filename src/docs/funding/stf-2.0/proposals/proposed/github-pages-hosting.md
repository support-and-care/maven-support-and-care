# GitHub/Codeberg Pages Hosting for Maven Sites

**Discussion:** https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/171

**Original Item:** "Make it easy (documentation?) to automatically create a Maven site for a GitHub-hosted project as a GitHub page, same for Codeberg/ Forgejo (Hendrik)"

## Problem Statement

The documentation of a Maven plugin is part of the generated site (generated by maven-site-plugin) that must be hosted somewhere.

## Current State / Starting Point

We can host the generated site on any webserver.

## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

Super easy and intuitive support (documentation) to host the generated site on GitHub pages (same for Codeberg/ Forgejo).

## Discussion Summary

The community confirmed interest but noted this [may primarily be a documentation task](https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/171#discussioncomment-15564220) rather than new plugin development.
The existing [`maven-scm-publish-plugin`](https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/171#discussioncomment-15564220) already supports GitHub Pages and could be better integrated into `maven-site-plugin`.
Supporting [hosting beyond GitHub](https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/171#discussioncomment-15609764) (e.g., Codeberg) was seen as important for resilience.
