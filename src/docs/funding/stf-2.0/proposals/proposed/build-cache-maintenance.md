# Build Cache Extension Project Maintenance

**Discussion:** https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care/discussions/196

## Problem Statement

The Maven Build Cache Extension project suffers from a significant maintenance backlog. Unreviewed issues and unmerged pull requests have accumulated, hindering project progress and discouraging contributors.

## Current State / Starting Point

- 60 open issues across three pages, many of them old and potentially stale
- Issues lack proper triage - unclear which are still valid, which are duplicates, which are low-hanging fruit
- 14 open pull requests waiting for review, including both dependency updates and feature implementations
- Missing documentation for some existing features
- No regular maintenance cadence established

## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

1. **Issue Triage**: Review older issues, close stale ones, flag still-valid ones, identify quick wins
2. **PR Review**: Systematic review of all 14 pending pull requests - merge, request changes, or close with explanation
3. **Dependency Updates**: Process pending library update PRs to keep the project current
4. **Feature Clarity**: Clarify the relevance and priority of proposed new features
5. **Restored Momentum**: Re-establish active maintenance to attract contributors
