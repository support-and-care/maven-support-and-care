# Support Versions in Hosted Maven Sites

**Original Item:** "Support Versions in hosted Maven Sites (Hendrik)"

**Note (Green):** "Mainly for examples"

## Problem Statement

Maven plugins evolve over time and so does the documentation.
When you depend on a specific version of a plugin, you should be able to access the documentation of that version.

## Current State / Starting Point

Today the Maven site plugin only supports one version of the documentation.

## Expected Outcomes / Benefits

Provide a way to host multiple versions of the documentation.
