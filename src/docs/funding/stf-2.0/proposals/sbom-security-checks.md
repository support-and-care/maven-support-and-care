# SBOM and Security Scorecard Verification

**Original Item:** "Plugin/extension / Whatever that checks for all dependencies if A) SBOM is published publicly, B) Security information like OpenSSF Scorecard is published publicly and show warnings / throw errors if not applied (Hendrik)"

**Note (Green):** "Idea: CRA is coming. It should help collect information about the dependencies based on SBOM and OpenSSF score card for example. Possible solution: new report plugin Maybe a relationship between both"
