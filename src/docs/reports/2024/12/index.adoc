In December 2024

* We established some documentation structure xref:../../../epics/README.adoc[for our Epics] to prepare and enable future work in a well-defined manner.
The goal is a structured approach for documenting and managing work on Apache Maven Support & Care epics, focusing on the lifecycle of complex technical issues.
The process involves iterative development, stakeholder discussions, and comprehensive documentation, starting from initial problem exploration through implementation phases and culminating in a final record of the solution.

* We investigated the current state of the Maven build (xref:../../../epics/77-maven-due-diligence/index.adoc[due-diligence]).
As a first result, we identified several Maven subprojects which we could not even build, in particular the so-called https://github.com/apache/maven-sources/tree/master/aggregator[Maven reactor-build].
