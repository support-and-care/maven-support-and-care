== Work Package 1 - Security of the Supply Chain
We started a set up of a https://github.com/eclipse-apoapsis/ort-server[ORT - Server] for analyzing Apache Maven projects.

== Work Package 2 - Maintenance
We helped migrating the first Jira projects (MJLINK, MASFRES).
We had some learning and extended the migration tool based on that learning.


== Work Package 3 - Modernisation of Core Feature

The Maven committers adopted most changes that we provided by xref:../../../epics/77-maven-due-diligence/index.adoc[Epic 77].
Due to the applied changes and ongoing development, we detected new issues with the Maven reactor build, e.g.,

* Problems with Doxia-based site building (the central landing page for all Maven documentation).
* Problems with Plexus build due to missing snapshots (The Maven project maintains some respective features of Plexus, though Plexus is not part of the Maven project).
