== Work Package 1 — Security of the Supply Chain

To create SBOMS for all Maven projects we work with the (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.apoapsis[Eclipse ORT-Server]).
That product needed some changes to work well with Maven.
Next to that we needed to configure it for all Maven projects.

== Work Package 2 — Maintenance

* We helped to migrate further Jira projects (MDEPLOY, MINSTALL, MPOM with component ASF).
We had some learning and extended the migration tool based on that learning.

* We created first PRs for maven-dependency-plugin and maven-jlink-plugin.

* The Maven project adopted the Codehaus Plexus project when Codehaus was retired years ago.
We contributed to further alignment of Plexus to Maven best-practices, i.e.,
to check for desired code formatting and license provisioning.
