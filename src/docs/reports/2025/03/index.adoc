== Work Package 1 — Security of the Supply Chain

We started analyzing how to set up a local K8s instance for ORT-server (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.apoapsis[Eclipse OSS Review Toolkit]).

== Work Package 2 — Maintenance

We helped to migrate further Jira projects (MDEPLOY, MINSTALL, MPOM with component ASF).
We had some learning and extended the migration tool based on that learning.

We created first PRs for maven-dependency-plugin and maven-jlink-plugin.
