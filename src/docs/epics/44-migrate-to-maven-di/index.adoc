= Migrate to Maven Dependency Injection

****
The major task of this epic is to _migrate (Maven) away from Plexus_ (original https://github.com/OpenElements/maven-support-care/issues/44[title]).
The https://github.com/OpenElements/maven-support-care/discussions/28[discussion] which led to the epic even mentioned a migration to https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.sisu[Eclipse Sisu].

However, this seems to be some kind of incomplete or at least non-precise as there are many Plexus components used in Maven.
Hence, we first need to clarify the scope of the epic by evaluating the current state and lead some xref:../README.adoc#sec:stakeholder-discussions[stakeholder discussions].
